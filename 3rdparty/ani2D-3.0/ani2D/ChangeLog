Fixed a bug in a meta mesh calculation. A search for a triangle containing
a given point requires an optional interpolation. Meta mesh does not
provide a data array for this interpolation; therefore, the interpolation
flag should off. The flag has been changed.

MinGW. Final mesh quality changed in some tests. Corresponding hecks 
for a mesh quality have been reduced in the affected packages to allow

*** 01/13/2010 Version 2.4 was released


Author:  K Lipnikov <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Sat Jan 9, 2010
Package: AniMBA
Details: In the presence of curved edges, the original model is scaled 
inside unit cube. Incorrect coordinates were provided for calculating
an analytic metric. This was fixed by removing routine scaleBack.

Author:  K Lipnikov <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Sun Dec 24, 2009
Package: AniFEM
Details: Added a new finite element, FEM_P1DG. This is the discontinuous
linear (P1) element. The degrees of freedom are associated with elements
(three numbers per element). In the current implementation, these degrees
of freedom at located at element vertices, so that formulas for the standard
P1 element can be reused. To use this element within a templated routine, 
the user must mark the degrees of freedom (in arrays templateR and 
templateC) as Edof.

The assembling procedure has been modified by adding a new rule. All
element-based degrees of freedom are collected in one bundle. Thus, the
mass matrix for this finite element is block-diagonal with as many blocks
as there are mesh triangles. No tutorials has been affected by this change.

simple mesh smoothing.  Tweaked and improved mesh size coarsening. Code
cleaned up, fixed memory leaks. AniAFT now returns error code instead of
exit(). 

Author:  K Lipnikov  <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Thu Dec 17, 2009
Package: aniFEM
Details: Edge counters were not initialized in template.f. However, they 
were used to set up iSYS. Usually these counters are not initialized
because they are not needed in to solve the problem. To avoid wrong memory 
access, the pointer to the list of counters was set to 1 and edges counters 
were set to 0. The bug was found by Yu.Vassilevski.

Date:    Sat Nov 21, 2009
Package: AniFEM
Details: Standartized calculation of discretization error via a function
call fem2Derr(). The maximum nomr of the error is calculated at quadrature
points. Original, time-consuming routines, were removed from the Tutorials.

Relocated assembling of a global matrix in sparse column format inside the 
main template routine. Thus, only one sparse matrix representation is 
used in the code. Additional multix-vector multiplication routines have
been added to file algebra.f.

Author:  K Lipnikov  <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Wed Nov 11, 2009
Package: AniFEM
Details: Modified calculation of finite element matrices for an edge. 
Original version did not work with functions returning boundary conditions.
In addition, added 5th-order quadrature with three points and quadratic 
finite element. Example of using non-constant boundary conditions is
in PackageFEM/mainBC.f

Author:  K Lipnikov  <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Wed Nov 4, 2009
Package: AniFEM

operator only.

Date:    Sat Oct 31, 2009

are zeros. A small number is added to the error on the first edge.

Author:  K Lipnikov  <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Mon Oct 26, 2009
Package: AniFEM
Details: The mapping point-to-elements could be overwritten by the mapping
point-to-boundary-faces. This bug was found during the finite element solution
of the Stokes problem with the P2 reduced-P0 element. It was fixed by 
allocating additional memory for the second mapping. 
In addition, memory allocation in template.f was slightly minimized.

Author:  K Lipnikov  <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Tue Oct 20, 2009
Package: AniMBA
Details: The edge with one frozen end-point and one flexible (moving) 
end-point could be collapsed to a mid-edge point. This bug was fixed 
by enforcing collapse of the edge only to the frozen end-point. 
Additional check was added that forbids collapse of an edge when one
end-point is frozen and the other one is a geometry vertex. 
Additional check was added to automatic global refinement of very coarse 
initial meshes. The refinement is forbidden when input data contain 
frozen triangles and/or frozen edges.


*** 09/15/2009 Version 2.3.1 was released


Author:  A Danilov  <a.a.danilov@gmail.com>

Improved title pages.

Author:  K Lipnikov <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Mon Aug 10, 2009
Package: AniVIEW
Details: Added a simple routine for calculating a velocity stream 
function. Its value at a mesh node is calculated by integrating the 
velocity function along mesh edges, d(\psi) = u dy - v dx. For 
incompressible flows, the value of the stream function \psi is 
independent of an integration path. The integration starts from a 
single point on a boundary where the value of \psi is fixed to zero.

Author:  K Lipnikov <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Sun Aug 9, 2009
Package: AniFEM
Details: Information exchange parameter iSYS had limited capabilities.
For instance, in the Navier-Stokes calculations, information about edge
degrees of freedom was not available. It resulted in a cumbersome data
management for approximating the convection term. This problem has been
fixed by extending the length of iSYS. Now, the following data are
passed into user-prepared code:
   iSYS(3) : triangle number
   iSYS(4) : 1st vertex number
   iSYS(5) : 2nd vertex number
   iSYS(6) : 3rd vertex number
 
   iSYS(7) : 1st edge number, connects vertexes 1 & 2, could be zero
   iSYS(8) : 2nd edge number, connects vertexes 2 & 3, could be zero
   iSYS(9) : 3rd edge number, connects vertexes 3 & 1, could be zero
 
   iSYS(10) : total number of points
   iSYS(11) : total number of edges,  could be zero
   iSYS(12) : total number of triangles
Leaving the first two entries for output information, removed a need 
for using a copy of iSYS during imposing boundary conditions. The user
code became shorter and therefore simpler.

Package: AniMBA, AniC2F
Details: Input/output parameter Metric had dimensions (3, MaxP) which is 
not intuitive for the user who provides metric only at nP nodes. This array
was incorrectly allocated in PackageC2F which resulted in memory corruption. 
The solution was to make Metric the input parameter.

Author:  K Lipnikov <lipnikov@gmail.com>
Date:    Sun Jul 20, 2009
Package: AniFEM
Details: Added the lowest-order Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM1) finite 
element. This the experimental feature yet. A new parameter FEM_BDM1 
was introduced for this element. The degrees of freedom are zeroth- 
and first-order moments of a vector function on triangle edges. First, 
the zeroth-order moments are enumerate on edges 12, 23, and 31. Second,
the first-order moments are enumerate in the same order.
