This code was created originally to observe impact of metric change on 
the adaptive mesh. The simple intuitive interface allows to select a 
metric and re-build the mesh. The user may look at the initial mesh and 
compare it with the adaptive mesh. 

The new features of this script allows to run some of the test problems
in Tutorials and even modify they behavior via selection of a few control
parameters. At the moment, the user can modify only one tutorial in 
MultiPackage/Stokes. To run the Python script, type 

   $ python main.py
