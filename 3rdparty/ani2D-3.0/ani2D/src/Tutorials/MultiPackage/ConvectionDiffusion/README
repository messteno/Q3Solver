*** Objectives ***
The package demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of the
boundary value problem:

  -div D grad u + vx * du/dx + vy * du/dy = 1 in Omega
                                        u = 0 on dOmega
where Omega has a backstep-like shape.

The diffusion coefficient D is the diagonal tensor given by
     D = diag{0.01,0.01}

The components of the convection vector are
     vx = 3
     vy = 2
The convection field is passed to FEM library through DATAFEM array.

The SUPG stabilization is NOT used here, since the adaptive mesh 
itself stabilizes the discretization.

   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries


   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, convection field, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.

   forlibmba.f - The user-prepared file for the library libmba2D (metric 
                 based mesh adaptation). The routines provide parameterization 
                 functions for curvelinear boundaries and metric. 
                 Since the computational domain is a polygon, these
                 functions are dummy functions.
