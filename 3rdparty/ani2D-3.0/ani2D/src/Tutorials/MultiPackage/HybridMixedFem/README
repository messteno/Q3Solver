*** Objectives ***

The program demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of
the boundary value problem:

   -div u = 1       in  Omega   (mass conservation eqn)
        u = -grad p in  Omega   (constitutive equation)
        p = 0       on  dOmega

where Omega is the convex pentagon. We shall refer to p as the 
pressure and u as the velocity. We use the mixed-hybrid finite
element method with the Raviart-Thomas finite elements. The
hybrid method results in a problem with a symmetric positive 
definite stisfness matrix for the Lagrange multipliers.

   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.
