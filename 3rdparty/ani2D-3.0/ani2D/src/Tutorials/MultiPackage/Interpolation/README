*** Objective.

The program main.f builds a mesh which minimizes the Lp norm
of interpolation error for function Func(x,y) defined in main.f.
The metric is defined on the basis of the recovered discrete Hessian.

The program mainGrad.f builds a mesh which minimizes the Lp norm of
the gradient of interpolation error for function Func(x,y) defined in mainGrad.f.
The metric is defined on the basis of interpolation errors at mid-edges.

These programs provide  examples of the adaptive loop and how to recover the metric
and to estimate the norm of the interpolation error.

The initial mesh is created starting from boundary edges using 
library libaft2D-3.x.a
