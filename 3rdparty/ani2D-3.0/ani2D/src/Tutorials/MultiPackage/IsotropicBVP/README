*** Objectives ***

Two programs demonstrate two approaches to the iterative adaptive solution of the
boundary value problem:

   -div (grad u) = 0  in  Omega
               u = g  on  dOmega_D
          du/dn  = 0  on  dOmega_N

where 
           Omega = { x^2 + y^2 < 1 \ {y=0, 0<x<1} }
        dOmega_N = { y=0, 0<x<1, bottom part of the cut line}
        dOmega_D = { x^2 + y^2 = 1} .OR. {y=0, 0<x<1, above part of the cut line}

and
               g = r^0.25 sin phi/4


*** Contents ***
   main_hes.f  - Main program with calls routines from Ani2D libraries.
                 The linear systems  are solved by the direct sparse factorizer.
                 The metric is recovered from the discrete Hessian of the solution 
                 so that the L_infty norm of the "interpolation error" be minimized.

   forlibfem_hes.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides also routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.
           
   main_est.f  - Main program with calls routines from Ani2D libraries.
                 The linear systems  are solved by the iterative solver with ILU preconditioner.
                 The metric is recovered from the edge-based a posteriori error estimates
                 so that the L_2 norm of the gradient of discretization error be minimized.
           
   forlibfem_est.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators, and routines for a posteriori error estimator). 
                 It provides also routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.
           

   forlibaft.c - File for library libaft2D (initial mesh generator). 
                 It provides the parameterization function for the curved 
                 boundary. The name of the function is passed to the 
                 libaft2D using 

                     external userboundary              
                     call registeruserfn(userboundary)

                 If both the registration and the model forlibaft.c are 
                 missing, the boundary should be given by a polyline.


   forlibmba.f - The user-prepared file for the library libmba2D (metric based 
                 mesh adaptation). It provides the parameterization function of 
                 the curved boundary. It should be the same as in forlibaft.c 
                 but written in FORTRAN77.
