*** Objectives ***
The package demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of the
boundary value problem:

   -div D grad u = 1  in  Omega
               u = 0  on  dOmega_D
          du/dn  = 0  on  dOmega_N

where Omega is the segment of the unit disk given by 

    {x^2 + y^2 < 1  &&  (x<0 || y>0)}

and the boundary of Omega consists of two pieces
dOmega_D and dOmega_N where

    dOmega_N = {x = 0  && -1 < y <0}.

The diffusion coefficient D is the diagonal tensor given by
    D = diag{10,10}  for  x < 0,
    D = diag{1,100}  for  x > 0.



*** Contents ***
   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries

   forlibaft.c - File for library libaft2D (initial mesh generator). 
                 It provides the parameterization function for the curved 
                 boundary. The name of the function is passed to the 
                 libaft2D using 

                     external userboundary              
                     call registeruserfn(userboundary)

                 If both the registration and the model forlibaft.c are 
                 missing, the boundary should be given by a polyline.

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.

   forlibmba.f - The user-prepared file for the library libmba2D (metric  based 
                 mesh adaptation). It provides the parameterization function of 
                 the curved boundary. It should be the same as in forlibaft.c 
                 but written in FORTRAN77.
