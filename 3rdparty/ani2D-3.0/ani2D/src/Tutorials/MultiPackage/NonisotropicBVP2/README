*** Objectives ***
The package demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of the
boundary value problem:

  -div D grad u + du/dx = 1 in Omega
                      u = 0 on dOmega

  where Omega = [0;1]x[0;1] - [0;1/3]x[0;0.5] (double rump example)

The diffusion coefficient D is the diagonal tensor given by
            D = diag{0.001,0.001}

The SUPG stabilization is NOT used here, since the adaptive mesh
itself stabilizes the discretization. The convection term is discretized
using operator DUDX (=du/dx).

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.
