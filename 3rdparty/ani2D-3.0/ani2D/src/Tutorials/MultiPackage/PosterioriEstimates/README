*** Objectives ***

The program demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of the
boundary value problem:

   -div K grad p = f    in  Omega   
               p = g    on  dOmega

where Omega is a bounded domain. We shall refer to p as the pressure. 
We use the P_1 finite element method with edge-based a posteriori error 
estimates.

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D-2.x.a. 
                 It provides routines for computing the diffusion tensor, 
                 boundary conditions and the right-hand side. It also
                 provides elemental matrices and right-hand sides for
                 the a posteriori estimator.
