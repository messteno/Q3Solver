These subdirectories contain examples of adaptive computation showing 
different features of the package:


Interpolation/    is a simple example generating an adaptive mesh to 
                  minimize the maximum error of P_1 intepolation

IsotropicBVP/     is an example of solving an elliptic boundary value 
                  problem (BVP) with isotropic singularity using an 
                  adaptive mesh. The domain is a disk with a cut.

NonisotropicBVP1/ is an example of solving an elliptic BVP with 
                  anisotropic singularity and jumping coefficients 
                  using an adaptive mesh. The domain is the disk without 
                  one quadrant.

NonisotropicBVP2/ is an example of solving an elliptic BVP with four
                  boundary layers in a polygonal domain. The adaptive 
                  mesh is anisotropic.

ConvectionDiffusion/ is an example of the convection-diffusion equation

HybridMixedFem/   is an example of hybrid mixed finite element 
                  discretization of the Poisson equation

Stokes/           is an example of mixed P2-P1 discretization of the 
                  Stokes problem in a polygonal domain with a hole.

StokesNavier/     is an example of mixed P2-P1 discretization of the 
                  Navier-Stokes problem (lid driven cavity).

UnsteadyConDif/   is an example of the FEM solution of the unsteady 
                  convection-diffusion equation with SUPG stabilization

PosterioriEstimates/ is an example of the  adaptive P_1 FEM solution 
                  of the diffusion problem using edge-based a posteriori 
                  error estimates.

DiscontinuousGalerkin/ is an example of the adaptive DG solution of
                  the Laplace equation using Hessian-based adaptation.
