*** Objectives ***

The program demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of the
boundary value problem:

   -div grad u  + grad p = 0   in Omega
         div u           = 0   in Omega

                       u = 0   on dOmega_1
                       u = u_0 on dOmega_2
                   du/dn = 0   on dOmega_3

where Omega is a domain with a circle hole,  dOmega_1 is the side 
at x=-2, dOmega_3 is the side at x=2, and dOmega_2 is the rest of 
the boundary. The non-homogeneous boundary condition is 

   u_0 = { 1-4y^2), 0 }.

We use the P2 finite elements for the velocity u and P1 finite elements 
for the pressure p, which are known to be stable. The discretization 
method results in a symmetric indefinite matrix.

   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries

   forlibaft.f - File for library libaft2D-3.x.a (mesh generator of initial mesh). 
                 It provides parameterization functions for the curved 
                 boundaries. The name of the function is passed to the 
                 libaft2D using 

                     external userboundary              
                     call registeruserfn(userboundary)


   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the matrix and the right-hand side.


   forlibmba.f - The user-prepared file for the library libmba2D-2.x.a 
                 (metric-based mesh adaptation). It provides parameterization 
                 functions of the curved boundary. It should be the same 
                 as in forlibaft.c but be written in FORTRAN-77.
