*** Objectives ***

The program demonstrates the iterative adaptive solution of the
lid driven cavity boundary value problem:

-div nu grad u  + (u.grad) u + grad p = 0   in Omega
         div u                        = 0   in Omega

                                    u = u_0 on dOmega_1
                                    u = 0   on dOmega_2

where Omega is the unit square, dOmega_1 is the side at y=1,
and dOmega_2 is the rest of the boundary. The non-homogeneous
boundary condition is

   u_0 = { 1, 0 }.

We use the P2 finite elements for the velocity u and P1 finite elements 
for the pressure p, which are known to be stable. SUPG stabilization of
the convective term is not used. The discretization 
method results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations with a 
saddle point structure.

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the Stokes matrix, the nonlinear function 
                 of Navier-Stokes residual  and the right-hand side.

   forlibinb.f - The user-prepared file for the library libINB (solution of
                 systems of nonlinear equations by Newton-Krylov method).
                 It provides routines for calling preconditioners and evaluation of
                 the nonlinear vector function.

   forlibaft.f - The user-prepared file for the library libAFT (initial mesh generator)
                 It provides the local mesh size function
