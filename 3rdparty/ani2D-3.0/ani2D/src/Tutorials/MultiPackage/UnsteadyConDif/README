*** Objectives ***
The package demonstrates the finite element (P_1 SUPG stabilized) solution 
of the unsteady boundary value problem:

  du/dt - div (D grad u) + vx * du/dx + vy * du/dy = 0  in  Omega
                                                 u = g  on  dOmega
  where Omega = [0;1]x[0;1]

The diffusion coefficient D is the diagonal tensor given by
     D = diag{0.0001, 0.0001}

The components of the convection vector are
     vx = 1
     vy = 0

   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries


   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.
