Project name:  C-wrappers for libraries of package Ani2D-3.x

Package name:  Ani2D-C2F.


1. What is Ani2D-C2F?
   The package contains C-wrappers for Fortran mesh generation routines 
in library aniMBA. It tries to hide memory management to reduce the list
of dummy parameters in C-routines.
Next package to be wrapped is aniFEM.


2. Quick Start 
We recommend to use cmake to build libraries and executables in tutorials. 
However, if you prefer to use our simplified Makefiles, compile the libraries 
using the Makefile in the root directory and then type in this directory:

   make exe
   make run-nod gs
   make run-ana gs
   make run-aud
