Package name:  Ani2D-LMR.


1. What is Ani2D-LMR?
  The program mainNodal2Metric.f shows how to recover a metric from a
  discrete function defined at mesh nodes. The metric is defined by the 
  spectral modulus of the discrete Hessian of this discrete function. 
  The metric depends on the Lp norm of the error that the user wants to
  minimize. Two methods for the Hessian recovery are available. To change 
  the recovery method, the user must replace call of Nodal2MetricVAR(...)
  with Nodal2MetricZZ(...).

  The program mainFunc2GradMetric.f demonstrates the metric building for
  minimizing the gradient of the P1 interpolation error. The metric depends 
  on Lp norm of this error that the user wants to minimize. The 
  interpolation error is calculated using a given function Func(x,y). 

  The program mainEst2Metric.f builds a metric from errors defined 
  either at centers of mesh elements or at centers of mesh edges. The 
  errors may be replaced by the user given error estimates. The current 
  release calculates the maximum norm of the interpolation error on elements 
  or edges using the user-defined function Func(x,y).



2. Requirements
  The package requires the following libraries
     lib/libmba2D-2.x.a
     lib/liblmr2D-2.x.a

  If these libraries are missing, please, build them using command
  'make lib' in directories src/aniMBA, src/aniLMR.



3. Quick start
  ls ../../../lib/   (if the required libraries are missing, build them)
  make exe
  make run-fnc 
  make run-grd 
  make run-est 
  make clean
