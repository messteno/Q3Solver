Project name:  Flexible Mesh Generator Using Metric Based Adaptation

Package name:  Ani2D-MBA.

Documentation: doc/user_guide.pdf

1. What is Ani2D-MBA?
  The FORTRAN-77 package Ani2D-MBA (re-)generates adaptive triangular
  meshes which are quasi-uniform in a metric. The metric may
  be given analytically, to generate a mesh with desired
  properties, or may be computed from a discrete solution,
  to generate a mesh adapted to this solution.
  The package can also improve the mesh quality and untangle meshes.
