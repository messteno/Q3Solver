Project name:   L2 FINITE ELEMENT PROJECTION.

Package name:  Ani2D-PRJ.

Documentation: doc/user_guide.pdf

1. What is Ani2D-PRJ ?
  The Fortran package Ani2D-PRJ project a finite element solution from
one unstructured triangular mesh to another. The solution may belong
to different finite element spaces on different meshes. The meshes should
occupy the same region. Otherwise, the package behavior is unclear.

This directory presents one example of using the libraty lib2Dprj.a 
A given P1 finite solution on one mesh is projected on a P2 finite element
solution on the other mesh.
