1. What is aniFEM?
  The Fortran 77 package aniFEM generates elemental matrices
for a general biliner and linear forms and different finite 
elements. The package also contains algorithms of fast 
assembling of elemental matrices.


2. Main features of fem2D.
(a) Simplicity and portability. It is written in Fortran 77,
    contains a few files, and a very simple Makefile. Since we 
    have not used any system dependent calls (except for time 
    measurement), the code is widely portable.

(b) Ability to generate matrices for six types of finite 
    elements and five first-order differential operator.

(c) Ability to generate matrices for systems of PDEs and
    variables coefficients.

(d) Ability to assemble arbitrary elemental matrices provided
    by the user.

(e) The library routines may be used in C++ and C codes in
    a manner similar to using the Lapack routines.


3. Installation guide.
  There is a PDF file doc/fem_guide.pdf explaining details of
package installation.


4. Available support.
  We hope that our friends and colleagues will try package aniFEM
in their research. We shall appreciate any remarks, comments and
we shall response to them ASAP. This will help us to improve future
versions of the package. The contact information is
