C ======================================================================
C The mesh generation can be controled in a few ways, mailnly through 
C the metric field. However, some mesh features may be missing. In order 
C to ensure additional (optinal) mesh features, we introduced the integer 
C variable status. Non-zero bits of this variable turn on the following
C mesh features:
C
C  bit 01 - (ANIForbidBoundaryElements=1): the final mesh must not
C           contain triangles with all vertices on the domain boundary.
C
C  bit 02 - (Reserved=2)
C
C  bit 03 - (ANIFixBoundaryEdges=4): the boundary edges will be
C           added to the list of fixed edges.
C
C           The feature may be useful for generating multi-block 
C           meshes or for preserving the initial boundary.
C
C  bit 04 - (ANIDeleteTemporaryEdges=8): the new edges created by 
C           the algorithm will be removed from the final mesh.
C
C           These new egdes may include material and domain boundaries.
C  
C  bit 05 - (ANIFixBoundaryPoints=16): the boundary points will be
C           added to the list of fixed points.
C
C           The feature may be useful for preserving complex 
C           geometries in anisotropic metric fields. 
C
C           Tjis feature does not prevent refinement of boundary edges.
C
C  bit 06 - (ANIUntangleMesh=32): the initial mesh may be tangled
C           This feature will try to untangle the mesh.
C
C ======================================================================
C The following bits reflect mesh features discovered by the algorithm. 
C We keep it for the user disposal.
C
C  bit 07 - (ANIMultiConnectedGeometry=64): the geometry is multi-connected.
C           
c  bit 08 - (ANIReserved=128)
C
C
C ======================================================================
C The following bits are under development. They will be automatically 
C removed from the initial value of status.
C
C  bit 09 - (ANISmoothMesh=256): the final mesh is supposed to be smooth.
C           The feature may be useful for extremely anisotropic meshes. 
C           It is not stable at the moment.
C
C  bit 10 - (ANIReserved=512):

C *** Remarks: 
C       1. Some features can be automatically turned on/off if the initial
C          grid does not comply with the options set up by the user.
C
C       2. The default feature (when flagAuto=.TRUE.) is 
C          ANIDeleteTemporaryEdges
